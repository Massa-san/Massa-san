# About me
Thanks for coming to my GitHub!  
My GitHub mainly deals with Java, C#, Python, etc...  
I make games in Unity, plugins and clients in Spigot, and other things, but I hope this helps!  

# Maybe there's some "unko" left.
In Japan, poop is often used in a light sense, not as a dirty word.  
I use "unko" or "unti" quite often in my debugging. Please let me know if this is the case.  
Maybe there's some "unko"or "unti" left.
